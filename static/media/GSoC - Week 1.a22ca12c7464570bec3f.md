# GSoC - Week 1

Hey everyone! I am so excited to say that I got accepted into the **GSoC** ~~(Good Supply of Carrots?)~~ (Google Summer of Code). That brings me here, writing my experience as I go on this sacred summer coding conquest.

## Introduction

~~I am sure you must have all heard about me,~~ I am **Prayas Jain**, and I just really love to code ~~and then cry over the errors~~ because after putting in hours into a project and finally seeing it bear fruits is one thing I could never get tired of. I am an IT undergraduate and I will be walking into the final year (hopefully?) of my college life.

Over the course of my college life, I have been told "Hey <someone> has been accepted into GSoC" countless times, and looking at them with an envious eye, I could look at their growth, at how their coding capabilities flourished when working on an open-source project. 

That is how I decided to get my share of experience with open-source development, which brought me to apply for GSoC this year. ~~Envy isn't so bad huh?~~

## Choosing the Project

**Choices**, *choices*, <u>choices</u>. There are so many choices given how the open-source community has expanded over last few years. To this, a friend of mine, lets call them theFriend (I absolutely love camelcase), who has been contributing under Weecology for an year now, suggested me to give a look at the Portalcasting project under them.

The `portalcasting` package provides a model development, deployment, and evaluation system for forecasting how ecological systems change through time, with a focus on a widely used long-term study of mammal population and community dynamics. 

The project proposed for GSoC this year under Portalcasting seemed a good fit with respect to what I like to do. The task is to eliminate the embarrassingly parallel problem (sounds embarrassing right?) that is present throughout the codebase.

The last project that I did had a similar issue so this particular project spoke to me, thats when I decided to choose this project ~~and use 100% of my system RAM leading to system crashes~~. 

\**cough*\* *\*cough*\*

Moving on, I contacted Henry Senyondo to show my interest towards this project and how it is shimmering in front of me. Henry, being a great mentor, helped me understand the Portal project a bit more, as to what the project entails and what needs to be done within it. 
Even through the hectic ~~and soul-drenching~~ process of Proposal Submission, Henry guided me at each corner as to what is a good way to write proposals so as to bring out our vision in a way it is understandable by everyone irrespective of whether they know about this project or not.  

The deadline for submission of the Proposal was 19th April while my birthday was on 17th April. Enjoying the night of my birthday, I woke up with a realisation,

*"Oh fudge. I have to write my proposal."*

The final touches and changes that were to be made were remaining and it was a touch and go for a moment when it came to submiting a ***good*** proposal.

## Acceptance (not the relationship kind)

"wow".

Thats what my mind had at the time when I saw my name listed under the names of people whose projects were accepted. Acceptance felt great at that time ~~not because someone rejected me recently or anything (lol)~~ and my mind left my body onto a different plane of reality. 

It was night time for me, and list hadn't updated,  my food was looking at me with glittery eyes, trying to lure me into eating it, yet I anxiously waited by GSoC's website.
When the wait was over, the dinner tasted extra special due to the extravagant flavour of this news.

## Community Bonding

During the course of community bonding period, Henry had been helping me understand the essence of the Portal Project, regarding how it is being conducted on the ground, apart from that, we would have weekly meetings with the other selected contributors under Weecology; Ansh and Nagesh. Working in an open-source environment, we get to see different ideas and learn from them in a very ***open*** manner.

Moving on, during the course of this project, my main aim would be to improve on the areas I know I am lacking in terms of coding, as well as to gather experience collaborating since that is a very integral skill when working on big and complex projects.

## * runs away *

Not really running away, but I believe I have conveyed everything that I wanted to convey ~~without letting my introverted side taking over~~. I'll be taking my leave and go watch Anya-san say *"waku waku"*. Bye.
